# Tips:

- Chrome's resource limits

When you download picture, this page uses more memory and cpu resources. If you switch to another page and the download page is not activated, Chrome will limit the resource usage of the download page, resulting in slow download.

Option 1: Keep the download page active, do not switch to other pages, so the download will not slow down. But this will affect our use of other pages.

Option 2: Pull out the downloaded tabs individually and become a separate window. This page is the only one in the new window and it is always active. Downloads are not affected, we can use other pages too.
